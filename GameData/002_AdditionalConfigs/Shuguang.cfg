    %title = Shuguang-2 Capsule
    %description = Shuguang, meaning "dawn" in Mandarin and also known as Project 714, was the first crewed spacecraft proposed by the People's Republic of China during the late 1960s.
    @description ^= The design was for a two-person capsule similar to the Gemini spacecraft that could be launched by the Long March 2A.
    @description ^= However, the project was cancelled in 1972 due to lack of financial and political support.

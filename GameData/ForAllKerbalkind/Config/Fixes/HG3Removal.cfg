//    [ FAK | NASA | HG-3 Removal ]
//
//    After a LOT of digging and comparisons, we've come to the conclusion that the HG-3 is a redundant engine that (honestly speaking) doesn't really need to exist.
//    This frees up the part's model, which could be used for alternative engines in the future.
//
//    A breakdown of the reasons and arguments is listed in the bullet points below.
//    Note that some of the original sources cited are paywalled or in books, which contain actual information from involved parties.
//
//    1.  The HG-3 engine was conceived in the 1960s as a hypothetical engine, designed around specifications needed for the Saturn Modified Launch Vehicke (MLV),
//        Reusable Orbital Transport (ROT) and Advanced Engine Design Studies/Programs.

//
//    2.  There is a common myth that Rocketdyne developed the HG-3, and exists as the "missing link" between the J-2 and RS-25.
//        This is completely false: Rocketdyne had no documented affiliation with the HG-3. It was actually a joint effort between MSFC and Pratt & Whitney.
//        There are more sources confirming Pratt & Whitney's involvement, than there are sources stating Rocketdyne - the only one being Mark Wade.

//
//    3.  The above is backed up by the fact that Rocketdyne was, at the time of the 1965 MSFC Saturn MLV Upper Stage Study, still working on up-rating the J-2 and F-1.
//        Both of those engines were part of said study, so it makes little sense for Rocketdyne to also be developing the HG-3 at the same time.

//
//    4.  A simple comparison between the statistics/specifications of the hypothetical HG-3 and the actually-developed P&W XLR129 shows that both engines are basically identical:
//        - Both engines stem from Pratt & Whitney.
//        - Both engines were to use LH2/LOX propellants.
//        - Both engines were to use a staged combustion cycle (a novel concept at the time, laying a foundation for the SSME program which the LR129 was also proposed for).
//        - Both engines were to be in the same thrust bracket (300k+ lbf thrust).
//        - Both engines were to have nearly identical Chamber Pressures (3080psi/20.7MPa), Isp (~450@Vac) and burn times (~500sec).
//        - Both engines had extendible nozzles (ROEngines fails to model this; likely an oversight).
//        [ Source: Jenkins, "The Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon; Volume II: Technical Description" ]
//
//    5.  The only real difference between the HG-3 and the XLR129 is that the latter was designed to be used on the USAF/CIA ISINGLASS Spaceplane, and saw actual development.
//        This also checks out, given that ISINGLASS requirements directly contributed to SSME requirements later down the road, which - again - the XLR129 was proposed for.

//        [ Source: AIAA, Paper 71-658 "Pratt & Whitney Aircraft's Space Shuttle Main Engine"]
//
//    6.  Even looking at Rocketdyne's early SSME development, there is zero reference to an HG-3, and initial proposals also look nothing like it.
//        This further disproves the myth that the HG-3 is in any way related to the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine, or Rocketdyne, as it would've been referenced.
//        [ Source: AIAA, Paper 71-659 "Rocketdyne's Space Shuttle Main Engine"]
//
//
//    [ General Summary: ]
//        - The HG-3 was conceived by P&W as a hypothetical engine for NASA MSFC's MLV and ROT programs, and not by Rocketdyne.
//        - It was cancelled in favour of up-rating Rocketdyne's J-2 and other engines that were already further along in development.
//        - Not wanting to waste their existing results, P&W looked to the CIA/USAF and their planned ISINGLASS spaceplane.
//        - ISINGLASS needed an engine with similar specifications to the ones outlined for the original HG-3 proposed for Saturn MLV.
//        - P&W took their existing "work" on the HG-3 and instead applied it to ISINGLASS, resulting in the XLR129 being developed.
//        - Conclusion: The HG-3 didn't really exist, as it actually just became the XLR129.
